# PRD Co-Author Skill

## Overview

The **PRD Co-Author** skill helps you write high-quality Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) through an interactive, collaborative process. It guides you through selecting the right PRD structure, drafting each section with best practices, and refining the document to ensure clarity and completeness.

## What Makes This Skill Special

### 1. **Adaptive to Project Type**
The skill automatically adapts based on whether you're writing a PRD for:
- **New products** → Comprehensive documentation with strategic context
- **New features** → Focused on integration and user value
- **Quality improvements** → Metrics-driven, technical focus
- **Bug fixes** → Lean and efficient

### 2. **Best Practices from Top Companies**
Incorporates proven patterns from:
- **Amazon** (PR/FAQ customer-centric approach)
- **Google** (data-driven comprehensive PRDs)
- **Meta/Microsoft** (structured enterprise documentation)
- **Lean startups** (one-pager format)
- **Basecamp** (Shape Up pitch format)

### 3. **Interactive Co-Authoring Process**
Rather than just providing a template, the skill:
- Asks targeted discovery questions
- Explains the purpose of each section
- Drafts content based on your input
- Iterates based on your feedback
- Reviews for completeness and consistency

### 4. **Comprehensive Reference Materials**
Includes three detailed reference documents:

**prd-sections.md** (8.5KB)
- Complete guide to every PRD section
- When to include each section
- What makes each section effective
- Section-by-section best practices

**prd-examples.md** (14KB)
- Real-world examples of well-written PRD sections
- Problem statements, metrics, features, technical specs
- Shows what "good" looks like

**prd-frameworks.md** (9.5KB)
- Different PRD approaches (Amazon PR/FAQ, Lean, Comprehensive, JTBD, Shape Up)
- When to use each framework
- How to adapt patterns to your needs

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Discovery Phase**
The skill asks questions to understand:
- Project type (product/feature/improvement/fix)
- Target audience (engineering/design/executives)
- Available materials (research/designs/business case)
- Constraints (timeline/compliance/integrations)

**2. Structure Selection**
Based on your answers, recommends:
- Appropriate PRD framework
- Essential sections to include
- Optional sections that add value
- Sections to skip for efficiency

**3. Section Co-Authoring**
For each section, the skill:
- Explains the section's purpose
- Asks specific questions to gather information
- Drafts well-structured content
- Seeks your feedback
- Refines based on your input

**4. Final Review**
Checks for:
- Completeness (all essential sections covered)
- Consistency (metrics align with problem, features address needs)
- Clarity (scannable, jargon-free, multi-audience accessible)
- Best practices (evidence-based, prioritized, specific)

## Key Features

### Intelligent Section Guidance

**Problem Statement**
- Guides you to articulate WHY (not just WHAT)
- Ensures evidence-based claims
- Uses Jobs-to-be-Done framework when appropriate
- Captures current workarounds and impact

**Success Metrics**
- Helps define measurable, specific KPIs
- Ensures baseline and target with timeframe
- Balances business, usage, and quality metrics
- Validates measurement methodology

**Features & Requirements**
- Applies MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Adapts detail level to project type
- Includes acceptance criteria
- Links to designs when available

**Scope Definition**
- Clearly defines what IS and ISN'T included
- Distinguishes future work from never-scope
- Documents assumptions
- Prevents scope creep

### Quality Checks

The skill ensures your PRD:
- ✅ Leads with problem before solution
- ✅ Grounds claims in evidence (data, research, user quotes)
- ✅ Uses plain English or defines jargon
- ✅ Remains scannable (headers, bullets, emphasis)
- ✅ Includes specific, measurable targets
- ✅ Prioritizes requirements (not everything is "must have")
- ✅ Defines clear non-goals

### Avoids Common Pitfalls

The skill helps you avoid:
- ❌ Jumping to solutions before understanding problems
- ❌ Vague success metrics ("improve satisfaction")
- ❌ Missing non-goals that cause scope creep
- ❌ Over-specification that limits creativity
- ❌ Single-audience writing
- ❌ Treating PRDs as static documents

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: New Feature PRD
```
User: "I need to write a PRD for a new AI categorization feature in our email app"

Skill: [Asks discovery questions about project type, audience, constraints]
      → Recommends Lean One-Pager structure with 6 core sections
      → Co-authors Problem Statement based on user research
      → Drafts Success Metrics with specific targets
      → Defines Features with MoSCoW prioritization
      → Reviews for consistency and completeness
```

### Scenario 2: Quality Improvement PRD
```
User: "Search is too slow, need a PRD for performance optimization"

Skill: [Identifies this as quality improvement, not feature]
      → Recommends lean structure (4 sections)
      → Focuses on current performance vs targets
      → Emphasizes technical requirements
      → Skips user personas and GTM sections
      → Creates metrics-driven, technical PRD
```

- User stories in "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format

### Clear Prioritization
- MoSCoW method (Must/Should/Could/Won't Have)
- Explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep
- Future considerations documented separately

### Multi-Stakeholder Clarity
- Scannable format (headers, bullets, bold text)
- Plain English or defined jargon
- Sections relevant to each audience (engineering, design, business)

### Iterative Mindset
- PRDs treated as living documents
- Change logs for version tracking
- Room for adaptation during development

## Tips for Success

### Before Starting
1. **Gather materials**: User research, data, designs, business case
2. **Understand audience**: Who will read and use this PRD?
3. **Know constraints**: Timeline, compliance, integration requirements
4. **Define scope**: Be clear what's in and out of this release

### During Co-Authoring
1. **Be specific**: Provide concrete examples and data
2. **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, ask the skill for clarification
3. **Iterate**: Don't expect perfection on first draft
4. **Review**: Check that content matches your intent

### After Completion
1. **Share early**: Circulate for feedback while it's a draft
2. **Validate**: Ensure technical feasibility with engineering
3. **Update**: PRD should evolve as you learn more
4. **Link**: Connect to related documents (specs, designs, research)

**Total size**: ~46KB of compressed, high-quality guidance

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. **Step-by-Step Discovery**
Instead of presenting a blank template, the skill guides you through understanding what you're building and why, then selects the appropriate structure.

### 2. **Section-by-Section Coaching**
Each section gets dedicated attention with:
- Clear purpose explanation
- Targeted questions
- Draft content
- Iterative refinement

### 3. **Adaptive to Context**
The skill recognizes that a new product needs different documentation than a bug fix, and adjusts accordingly.

### 4. **Quality by Design**
Best practices are embedded in the workflow, not tacked on at the end. You get a high-quality PRD naturally by following the process.

### 5. **Learning While Doing**
The reference materials teach PRD writing principles while you're actively creating, reinforcing learning through practice.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the skill** in your Claude environment
2. **Start a conversation** with "I need to write a PRD for [your project]"
3. **Answer discovery questions** about your project
4. **Work through sections** with the skill's guidance
5. **Review and refine** until your PRD is ready

The skill will handle the rest - recommending structure, asking the right questions, drafting content, and ensuring quality.
